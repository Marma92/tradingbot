# Trading Strategy Project

## Overview

This project implements a trading strategy based on sentiment analysis of news headlines.

The strategy utilizes the Alpaca API for executing trades and Yahoo Finance data for backtesting.

The main goal of the strategy is to identify trading opportunities based on sentiment signals derived from news articles related to a specific asset.

## Features

Sentiment Analysis: The strategy fetches news articles related to the trading symbol and estimates sentiment using a natural language processing model.

Position Sizing: It calculates the quantity of shares to trade based on available cash and current price of the asset.

Risk Management: The strategy incorporates basic risk management techniques such as stop-loss orders.

Backtesting: Historical data from Yahoo Finance is used for backtesting the strategy's performance over a specified period.
